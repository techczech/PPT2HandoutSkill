## [Unreleased]

## [1.3.0] - 2026-01-15

### Added
- **Image categorization** - AI now classifies images into categories during analysis
  - Categories: cartoon, interface_screenshot, chat_screenshot, tweet, quote, academic_paper, diagram, chart, photo_person, book_cover, product_page, other
  - Category filter dropdown in Media Gallery page
  - Category badge displayed on each image in gallery
- **Processing statistics** - Track and display AI analysis metrics
  - New `processingStats.json` file generated after image analysis
  - Tracks: images processed, tokens used, category counts, processing duration
  - About page now displays AI processing stats when available
- **Token usage tracking** in analyze-existing-images.py script
  - Reports input/output/total tokens used during analysis
  - Displayed in terminal output and saved to stats file

### Changed
- **analyze-existing-images.py** significantly updated
  - Added image category classification to prompt
  - Added token tracking via response.usage_metadata
  - Generates `processingStats.json` with detailed metrics
  - Upgraded from Gemini 3 Flash Preview to Gemini 2.0 Flash
  - Category breakdown shown in terminal output
- **MediaGalleryPage.tsx** enhanced
  - Added category filter dropdown (only shows when categories exist)
  - Category badge on image cards replacing generic "Key" badge
  - Updated filtering logic to support combined type + category filtering
- **AboutPage.tsx** enhanced
  - New "AI Image Analysis" section (conditional on stats file existing)
  - Shows images analyzed, tokens used, categories detected
  - Category breakdown with counts

### Documentation
- Updated skill to document new image categorization feature
- Added processingStats.json to file structure documentation

## [1.2.0] - 2026-01-14

### Added
- **AI-driven entity extraction** replacing mechanical regex-based extraction
  - New `entities.json` file generated by AI during skill execution
  - Properly identifies people, quotes, organizations, tools, terms, and dates
  - AI model understands context (e.g., distinguishes real quotes from random image text)
  - Key images get rich descriptions with context (source, date, type of content)
- **New workflow step: "Analyze Content for Entities"** (Step 4)
  - AI reads presentation.json and creates entities.json with semantic understanding
  - Detailed instructions for identifying each entity type
  - JSON format specification for entities.json

### Changed
- **extractResources.ts** completely rewritten
  - Now reads from `entities.json` instead of using regex patterns
  - Removed hardcoded `KNOWN_TOOLS`, `KNOWN_ORGANIZATIONS`, `KNOWN_PLACES` lists
  - Removed regex patterns for quotes, dates, people
  - Keeps mechanical URL extraction (URLs are unambiguous)
  - Much simpler and more maintainable code
- **Skill workflow** updated with new step numbering
  - Step 4: Analyze Content for Entities (new)
  - Step 5: Generate sessionInfo.ts (was Step 4)
  - Step 6: Process Media (was Step 5)
  - Step 7: Preview and Review (was Step 6)
  - Step 8: Deploy (was Step 7)
- **File structure** documentation updated
  - Added `entities.json` to src/data/
  - Added `extractResources.ts` under src/utils/

### Fixed
- **False positive quotes** - Previously showed 115+ "quotes" that were just random text in images; now shows only actual attributed quotes
- **Missing people** - Previously identified only 1 person via regex; now AI finds all people mentioned (24 in test presentation)
- **Poor image context** - Tweets now described as "Tweet by X on Y date" instead of just the text content

### Removed
- Hardcoded entity lists from extractResources.ts (now AI-driven)
- Regex-based quote detection (unreliable)
- Pattern-based people/organization extraction

## [1.1.0] - 2026-01-14

### Added
- **Automatic video compression** for videos exceeding 25MB file size limit
  - Uses ffmpeg to compress videos during build process
  - Automatically calculates optimal bitrate based on video duration and target size
  - Compresses to 24MB (with headroom) to fit Cloudflare Pages' 25MB limit
  - Gracefully falls back if ffmpeg is not installed (logs warning)
  - Logs compression progress and final file sizes
- **Improved skill workflow** to reduce back-and-forth with users
  - New Step 1: Gather key information upfront before starting work
  - Collects project name, presentation title, presenter name/link, input type, and deployment target
  - Uses AskUserQuestion tool for efficient information gathering
  - Deployment target question optimizes for platform-specific constraints
- **ffmpeg requirement** added to documentation
  - Installation instructions for macOS, Linux, and Windows
  - Marked as optional but recommended for Cloudflare Pages deployment
  - Added to README requirements section
  - Added to skill requirements section

### Changed
- **processMedia.js** now includes video compression logic
  - Imports `execSync` from `child_process` for ffmpeg commands
  - New functions: `hasFFmpeg()`, `getVideoInfo()`, `compressVideo()`
  - Modified media processing loop to check video sizes and compress when needed
  - Enhanced logging to show compression status and video counts
- **Build process** now includes video compression step
  - Updated README build process documentation
  - Added note about automatic compression when deploying to Cloudflare Pages
- **Skill workflow** restructured for better efficiency
  - Step 1 now focuses on upfront information gathering
  - Step 3 added for optional content review
  - Step 4 updated to use information from Step 1
  - Step 5 documents automatic video compression behavior

### Fixed
- Cloudflare Pages deployment failures due to videos exceeding 25MB limit
  - Videos are now automatically compressed during build
  - Prevents deployment errors and manual compression steps

### Documentation
- Updated README.md with video compression feature
- Added "Automatic video compression" to features list
- Updated build process to mention compression step
- Added ffmpeg to requirements with installation instructions
- Added troubleshooting section for large video deployment issues
- Updated skill documentation (.claude/skills/pptx-to-handout.md)
